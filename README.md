# react-hook-form
## Description
This project attempts to create a common binding between react-hook-form and the input components of various other libraries.

Target Libraries:
- [React Hook Form (v7)](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [MUI (v5)](https://mui.com/)
- [MUI X (for DatePicker)](https://mui.com/x/)
- [react-number-format](https://github.com/s-yadav/react-number-format#readme)

## Philosophy
### Simpleness
We only organize and publish the APIs that each library originally has, and do not create our own APIs as much as possible.
So there is no need to learn a new API.

### Limitless
The functionality of each library is provided without restriction, so users have full access to the functionality of the original libraries (MUI, React Hook Form). 

## Demo
The sample application is deployed below.
